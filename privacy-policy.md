**Privacy Policy for Bookmarks for Google Chat™**  
*Last updated: February 28, 2025*

This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use the Service. It also explains your privacy rights and how the law protects you. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### **Definitions**

* **Company**: Refers to Beats and Bytes Studios, the developer of the application.  
* **Service**: Refers to the Bookmarks for Google Chat™ extension.  
* **You**: The individual accessing or using the Service, or the company or legal entity on behalf of which such individual is accessing or using the Service.

### **Collection and Use of Your Personal Data**

#### **Types of Data Collected**

* **User Preferences**: The sorting preferences you choose for organizing your bookmarked chats are stored locally on your device.  
* **Chats/Bookmarks Data**: We store the text content of chats you have chosen to bookmark, along with associated metadata for specific chat messages (such as the sender, timestamp, and chat title). This data is stored locally on your device and is linked to the current user via a unique internal ID associated with their Google account, which is retrieved when the user logs in to the extension.

Please note that if a chat message is deleted from Google Chat, it may remain stored in your local bookmarks until you manually delete it through the extension's interface.

#### **Password for Access**

To use the extension, a password is required to enable encryption of your data. The password is used to generate encryption keys locally on your device, and the encryption process occurs solely on your machine. The password does **not** authenticate with any remote server. The password ensures that your data is accessible only by you.

#### **Use of Your Personal Data**

Your data is processed locally on your device to:

* **Provide and maintain the Service**: This includes managing the functionality that allows you to bookmark and preview your chats.  
* **Manage your preferences**: We store your sorting preferences locally to manage the organization of your bookmarked chats.

#### **Retention of Your Personal Data**

Your Personal Data (including bookmarks and preferences) is stored locally on your device and is only retained for as long as necessary to provide the Service. You have full control over this data and can delete or modify it directly through the extension’s interface. Uninstalling the extension will remove all locally stored data.

The data is not transferred to any remote server.

#### **Data Storage and Encryption**

The extension stores your data locally on your device in an encrypted format. The encrypted data is linked to the current user via a unique internal ID number. This data remains encrypted and is decrypted only when you enter your password to access the extension. Once decrypted, the data is available for use by the extension for the current session. Upon session expiration, the data is no longer accessible in a decrypted format until the next time the user logs in.

#### **Transfer of Your Personal Data**

Since your data is stored and processed locally on your device, it is **not** transferred outside of your device unless you choose to share it. We do not store any data remotely or transfer it to third parties.

#### **Deleting Your Personal Data**

You can delete any stored data directly through the extension’s interface. The data will remain on your device until you manually delete it. If you uninstall the extension, all locally stored data, including bookmarks and preferences for all users, will be deleted.

### **Children’s Privacy**

Our Service does not knowingly store personal information from anyone under the age of 13\. If you believe that a child has stored personal data using our extension, you may delete the data directly through the extension’s interface. If you are concerned, you can uninstall the extension to remove all stored data.

### **Security of Your Personal Data**

The security of your Personal Data is important to us. As the data is stored and retrieved locally on your device, it is not transferred over the internet. We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data, but we cannot guarantee its absolute security, as no method of local storage or transmission is entirely secure.

### **Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.
